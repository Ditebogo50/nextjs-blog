## Next.JS Task (portfolio page)

This project is a task creating a mini portfolio-page for the SovTech software developer sassignment for their graduate programme.
I used React to create the project and Next.JS framework. I deployed the app using Vercel. 

* **What we expect from you?**<br>
You'll use this base in various workspaces throughout the course to build the project incrementally as you expand your skills. At each stage, there will be **various 'TODO's marked for you to complete.** You'll also notice some TODOs in the frontend section in the upcoming workspaces. 


### Exercise starter code and solution
