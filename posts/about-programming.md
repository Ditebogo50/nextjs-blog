**Full stack web development**
A stack is a collection of technologies/software that is required for web development, they work together to create a web appluication. Examples of stacks are LAMP and MERN. Full stack development that is carried out by a full stack developer and one can work on both the back_end and the front_end i.e develop both the client and server.

**Types of server functions are typically implemented for the back-end of a web application**
Most web applications feature back end stack made up of key elements including: The server on which the wwebsite's data is stored and web applications are usually backed by web servers and application servers. Web servers can be described as computers that have an internet connection and have software that allows web pages to be available to clients. They store images,HTML, CSS and Javascript files needed for thr function of web applications. They also need software that allow it to act as an HTTP server. Application servers code or business logic needed to build resources to be passed back to the browser. A proxy server is a intermediary(“intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.) server that forwards requests for content from multiple clients to different servers across the Internet. The database stores and manages all the data needed for a website, they can be queried to fetch and return information on-demand to be displayed by the front end website. The API, is almost like a filter through which third-parties can access information from a database, it allows developers to use other website's data like social media posts, for example — in their own apps.

**What happens when a browser is used to send a request to a server?**

A web browser is used to request resources from a web server and then present these resources to the user. When a browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, it asks it to send a copy of the website to the client. The message and all data sent between client and server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP. If server approves the request it sends the website's file to browser and the browser assembls the files into complete webpages and displays it to user. So the browser parses the HTML to create DOM tree, then the CSS is parsed and combined with the DOM to create a render tree which describes what should be rendered and how they should be styled then all elements are displayed in the browser. SSR takes JvavaScript framework and renders it to static HTML and CSS on the server, so Javascript is executed on the server and the resulting HTML rendered is sent to the browser. With CSR the browser gets an empty document with links to a javascript. So the browser will render the HTML from server without waiting for the javascript to be downloaded.
